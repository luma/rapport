### TODO

* put it on github
* rename the module to Rapport
* finish setting up compile to es5 for publish
* codeclimate + travis CI
* document each type + their constraints and trade offs
* document the size of the types, as opposed to the size you intuitively expect them to be
* implement the set from An Optimized Conflict-free Replicated Set
* code coverage
* publish it on npmjs
* experiment with how to exchange replica changes for merging (ops or full state) (1)
* following 1, looking into using deltas of the full state (and how this is different than just using ops?)
